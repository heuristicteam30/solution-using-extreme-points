# Extreme Points Heuristic with Neighbourhood Swapping

This solution uses heuristics for deciding the ordering for objects, the extreme points heuristic for deciding which objects go where, and then uses neighbourhood swapping to explore and find better solutions.

To run this, simly execute
```
make
./solution
```
